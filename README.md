# About
When the application is first launched, the user is asked which library they want to use.
Then, using the selected library, an API call is made to the TradingView platform to retrieve stock data (price, change, etc.). The data obtained through the API call is displayed on the screen. If the user wishes, they can tap on a stock to open a dialog box containing technical data for that stock. Additionally, the user can search for a specific stock by entering data into the box at the top and can refresh all data by running SwipeRefreshLayout.

The main purpose of the project is to teach developers how to make API calls using Retrofit, Volley, OkHttp and HttpUrlConnection.
